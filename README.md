# bundleslang
Bundles Lang - A quick and easy syntax to mine the internet

It's simple, a big ol bundle of controllers on the backend, running queryies 

You can hit any page on my site, ask it for a bundleslang and it'll pull a local graph out of unstructured data repositories!
example:

:1337/wikidata.bundleslang#pizza

Is read first for pages or site content to render to the client
But designatig a .bundleslang will switch the search from internal search results, to pre-written common data query's against popular apis such as facebook open-graph,
